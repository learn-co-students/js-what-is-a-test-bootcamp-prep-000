# Professional Testing With Javascript

As you can imagine it gets a bit unwieldy to have hundreds of `if` statements throughout your code. Beyond them being just a bit large, they lack organization when categorizing features and they also can be somewhat difficult to read. All of these problems are amplified when there are so many!

For many years, `if` statements is all we had though. So, we kept using them. In the past few years, programmers have created a bunch of new testing tools to make testing easier when dealing with many many many many tests. It doesn't matter too much, but the main one we are going to be using is called [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

Let's walk through the basics of testing. You'll discover it's not too different from what you've experienced in the last few labs. First things first, open up `index.js` in your terminal. You are going to see mostly familiar things:

```javascript
var name = "Joe"
var height = "74"
var message = `${name} is ${height} inches tall`

module.exports = {name, height, message}
```

This should look familiar except for that third line: `` var message = `${name} is ${height} inches tall` ``. It's actually pretty cool what that line does. Explore what ends up in the `message` variable by typing `console.log(message)` on the last line and then run your `index.js` file. You should see `"Joe is 74 inches tall"`. Pretty cool right? If you create a string wrapping it in back-ticks (`` ` ``) you can then use your variables directly in the string to create a sentence like
we just did. The key is when you use a variable you have to wrap the variable itself in the `${` and `}`. If you were to modify `message` to look like this: `` var message = `name is height inches tall` ``, and run your code again you'd get `"name is height inches tall"`. That's not what you want! The `${` and `}` tell Javascript to grab the value inside the variable, not just that variable name.

### The Tests

We have our code, now let's take a look at the tests. They are located in the `test` folder inside a file named `index-test.js`. In this lesson we are going to go over all of the tests, and then show you how to run them in the next lesson.

```javascript
var index = require("../index.js")

/*

describe("what-is-a-test", () => {
  describe("Name", () => {
    it('returns "Susan"', () => {
      expect(index.name).toEqual("Susan")
    })
  })


  describe("Height", () => {
    it("is less than 40", () => {
      expect(index.height).toBeLessThan(40)
    })
  })

  describe("Message", () => {
    it("gives the name and height", () => {
      expect(index.message).toInclude(index.name)
      expect(index.message).toInclude(index.height)
    })
  })

})

*/
```

The first thing you'll notice is that all of the code is commented out using the `/*` and `*/` block commenting syntax. This is because we will get into actually running the tests in the next lesson. This lesson, let's just walk through what you are seeing. In the next lesson the `/*` and `*/` will be removed.

There is a lot here. Right now, you really just need to focus on a few different lines. The first grouping is testing our `name` variable.

```javascript
  describe('Name', () => {
    it('returns "Susan"', () => {
      expect(index.name).toEqual('Susan')
    })
  })
```

If you look at the line that begins with `expect` you'll see this: `expect(index.name).toEqual('Susan')`. Read that out in English "Expect index.name to equal Susan". That's exactly what it's saying! If we continue down to the Height section you'll see this code:

```javascript
  describe("Height", () => {
    it("is less than 40", () => {
      expect(index.height).toBeLessThan(40)
    })
  })
```

The interesting line here is `expect(index.height).toBeLessThan(40)`. If you read that one out as "Expect `index.height` to be less than 40" you'd be correct! Let's look at the final one:

```javascript
  describe("Message", () => {
    it("gives the name and height", () => {
      expect(index.message).toInclude(index.name)
      expect(index.message).toInclude(index.height)
    })
  })
```

This one has two `expect` statements. If you read them out as English you'll discover that the tests expects `index.message` to include both `index.name` and `index.height`.

OK Great. You now understand what the tests are saying. Let's run our tests and submit our code to learn. In the terminal first type `learn`. You should get a message saying `0 passing` and the local build light will turn green. Then to submit your code up, type `learn submit` in the terminal. You should be good to go forward now! In the next lesson we are going to cover how to run them, and then have you actually solve the lab!
